### Hey there, I'm Val 👋


I am currently working as a software engineer at Alarm.com where I work full-stack on a variety of projects including deep re-designs of existing UI, large-scale data processing tools, and forward-looking efforts to re-architect our codebase. Professionally, I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality, impactful software across various industries and I enjoy collaborating to solve complex problems as well as quickly learning new concepts.

I'm interested in becoming more active in FOSS, as well as in pursuing other technical topics that interest me via personal projects, so you might start seeing my personal account here pop up more often!

To learn more about me and see some of the stuff I've been working on, check out my [website](https://valkozarev.netlify.app/), my LinkedIn, and my public project repos here on GitHub.
