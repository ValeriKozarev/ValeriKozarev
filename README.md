### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is [Valeri Kozarev](https://valerikozarev.github.io/), and I am a software developer currently located in Madison, Wisconsin.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on re-building my website
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue and NuxtJS
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my home country of Bulgaria, hiking, cooking, or my dog, June
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ValKozarev), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeri-kozarev/)
- :adult: Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.
