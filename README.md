### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is [Valeri Kozarev](https://valerikozarev.github.io/), and I am a software developer at Epic in Madison, Wisconsin. Check out my profile to see some cool personal projects that I've done over the years! Unfortunately, I tend to delete most repos after I'm done with them so browse while you can!
